### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm _RFSryro_ and this is my GitHub page. I'm a student at WGU and a LAN/WLAN engineer by day. and going to school by night. When I'm not studying, or working on switches/ access-points, I'm usually out hiking with my dog.

âš¡ Fun fact: I can recite every U.S. President's last name in the order that they were elected in under 12 seconds! 
...Now that I've told you that, I should probably change the password to one of my email accounts on Tor... ðŸ¤£

### Thanks for stopping by!
